# Cut Vertices and Bridges

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components. They are useful for designing reliable networks. [^cut-vertex] A graph is _Biconnected_ iff it doesn't have cut vertex. biconnectivity is NOT transitive.

An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects the graph. For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge is an edge removing which increases number of disconnected components.

Like Articulation Points, bridges represent vulnerabilities in a connected network and are useful for designing reliable networks. [^bridge] A graph is _2-edge-connected_ iff it doesn't have bridge. 2-edge-connectivity is transitive, i.e., if X, Y, and Z are three vertices in the graph, X is 2-edge-connected with Y, and Y is 2-edge-connected with Z, then X is 2-edge-connected with Z.

Both of these problems can be solved by Tarjan's algorithm. It only runs DFS once. For a graph represented by adjacency list, its worst-case time complexity is $O( | V | + | E | )$.

Adjacency List

- 0: 1 -> 2
- 1: 0 -> 2 -> 3
- 2: 0 -> 1 -> 4
- 3: 1 -> 4
- 4: 2 -> 3 -> 5
- 5: 4 -> 6
- 6: 5

## Cut Vertices

```py
from typing import List, Set
from collections import defaultdict


def cut_vertices(graph: List[List[int]]) -> Set[int]:
    if not graph:
        return set()

    dfn = {}
    low = {}
    parent = defaultdict(lambda: None)
    step = 0
    ans = set()

    def dfs(u):
        nonlocal graph, dfn, low, parent, step, ans
        dfn[u] = step
        low[u] = step
        step += 1

        children_cnt = 0
        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in dfn:
                children_cnt += 1
                parent[v] = u
                dfs(v)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                if parent[u] is None and children_cnt > 1:
                    ans.add(u)

                if parent[u] is not None and low[v] >= dfn[u]:
                    ans.add(u)
            elif v != parent[u]:
                low[u] = min(low[u], dfn[v])

    dfs(0)
    return ans
```

## Bridges

```py
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict


def bridges(graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int]]:
    if not graph:
        return []

    dfn = {}
    low = {}
    parent = defaultdict(lambda: None)
    step = 0
    ans = []

    def dfs(u):
        nonlocal graph, dfn, low, parent, step, ans
        dfn[u] = step
        low[u] = step
        step += 1

        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in dfn:
                parent[v] = u
                dfs(v)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                if low[v] > dfn[u]:
                    ans.append((u, v))
            elif v != parent[u]:
                low[u] = min(low[u], dfn[v])

    dfs(0)
    return ans
```
